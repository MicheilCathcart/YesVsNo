Because for me, “...born from frozen ovary, collected during...” reads as if it was the first time a child was ever born form a frozen ovary, and the rest ist just additional detail. Whereas without the comma, it would mean that it was the first time from 2a ovary removed ü in early puberty, not the first time altogether (as the article states in the last paragraph).
Does English work that way?",

The title should say “World’s first baby born from frozen ovary collected during the mother’s childhood”.",
